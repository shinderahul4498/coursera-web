			Sakkarai pongal
		</div>
		<p>
			This sweet, buttery dish is made with freshly harvested new rice, jaggery and ghee (clarified butter), with the addition of dried coconut, sesame seeds, raisins, milk, and cashew nuts. Sakkarai pongal is traditionally prepared as an offering to the Sun God during Makar Sankranti, a three-day harvest festival in mid-January, celebrated in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.
            The rice is typically cooked outdoors over a fire, with the cooking pots turned to the East, where the sun rises, and it is also customary to allow the dish to pongal, meaning to boil over during cooking, which symbolizes an abundance of food.
            This creamy, aromatic porridge is traditionally served alongside savory donuts called vadas and coconut chutney.

			Hyderabadi Biryani
		</div>
		<p>
			Hyderabadi biryani is a South Indian dish consisting of basmati rice, goat, mutton, or chicken meat, lemon, yogurt, onions, and saffron. There are two main varieties of the dish â€“ kachchi (raw) and pakki (cooked). It is said that Hyderabadi biryani's richness of flavor is due to the unique process of cooking raw rice and raw meat together with exotic spices, unlike other places where meat and rice are cooked separately.
            The special cooking style, known as dum, is believed to have come from Persia during the Mughals' regime in India.

			Mughlai biryani
		</div>
		<p>
			Mughlai biryani is a variety of Indian biryani that is believed to have been savored by the Mughal Emperors in the past. The dish is made with flavored rice, chunks of spiced and browned meat (usually lamb), fried onions, sultanas, and dry fruits such as almonds, which are layered in a pot, and then cooked together, yielding a highly-aromatic specialty said to be fit for a king.
			A large amount of aromatic spices such as saffron, nutmeg, cardamom, cumin, and cinnamon contributes to the rich and intense flavor of the biryani, making it perfect for festive occasions and religious events such as Eid. Mughlai biryani is typically consumed warm, either on its own or complemented by raita on the side.
