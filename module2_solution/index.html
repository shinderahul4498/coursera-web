                    HMy grandpa has a huge collection of classic novels in his house and sometimes I like to take a couple down to look at. I came across The Three Musketeers a couple weeks ago; of course I had heard of the famous book, but I did not know anything about it other than the fact that the book featured not three musketeers, but actually four. Regardless, I decided to skim the first chapter. Immediately, I was drawn into its world of intrigue and subtle beauty.

                    I have read this book. My mother borrowed it from the library of her school and gave it to me to read it in the difficult time of lock down. I read it and was amazed! I recommend it to every child who wants to read adventurous stories! The Cardinal, The duke of Buckingham, D'artagnan, and many more are there to take you in your own imaginary world.
